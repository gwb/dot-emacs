Here are some examples of using hydra, from older configs.

* hydra-org
I've removed it from my config because, well, I wasn't using it at all.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda () 
              (defhydra hydra-org (org-mode-map "C-.")
                "Org outline movements"
                ("s" outline-up-heading "step out")
                ("k" outline-next-visible-heading "next")    
                ("j" outline-previous-visible-heading "back")  
                ("f" org-forward-heading-same-level "next (same level)")
                ("d" org-backward-heading-same-level "back (same level)")  
                ("SPC" org-cycle "fold/unfold")
                ("l" org-metaleft "promote")
                (";" org-metaright "demote"))))
